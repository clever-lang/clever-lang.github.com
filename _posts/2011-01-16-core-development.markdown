The *Clever Team* is usually on-line at IRC #clever (irc.freenode.net)

### Coding standards

Currently we have used the Google C++ Style Guide [1] as base for the coding standards on the project.

Other rule are:

 * C++ files uses .cc
 * Headers files uses .h
 * Indentation: tab (width: 4)
 * Line ending: LF (Unix)
